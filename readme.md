# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

This repository is to track my progress through the textbook Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

The textbook is available online at [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

Video lectures of the chapters are available at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW).

PDFs of the book and hard copies are also available for purchase, but I am not linking them here.

I will be pairing this with [exercism.io](http://exercism.io) - but I will largely be skipping CompSci theoritical problems to save time.
